                    Between 2017 and 2021, in Puerto Rico were reported 82 intimate femicides – or the murder of women by an intimate partner or ex-partner. Most of them, 59%, were carried out with a gun.

                    <iframe title="Methods used in the killing of women by an intimate partner (2017-2022)" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-D4F3a" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D4F3a/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="447"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

                <p>“When a firearm is fired, the chances of it being a fatal injury are much higher than if a person receives several stab wounds or is hit,” explained Debora Upegui-Hernández, an analyst at the Gender Equity Observatory “If the method had been another, perhaps we would be talking about an attempted femicide."</p>
                <p>Studies show that high availability of firearms fuels lethal violence against women, particularly in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). And Puerto Rico presents a deadly formula: high firearms trafficking added to an increasingly flexible Weapons Act, with a new lenient version that went into effect July 1, 2020.</p>
                <p>In two out of three cases in which a firearm was involved, the perpetrator had a permit to use it. Although researchers, activists and organizations who offer support to IPV survivors are asking for better gun control, the Government's response was arming survivors.</p>

                <div class="plot-holder">
                    <iframe title="The number of background checks for firearm purchases in Puerto Rico increased 130% after changes to the gun law" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-QJ2i9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QJ2i9/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="604"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                </script>
                </div>

                <p>The Wepons Act also introduced a new expedited firearm license for IPV survivors. Since 2020 to April this year, 210 permits were issued, 189 of them to women. The profile of those who renewed or got a new license after the new Weapons Act differ from the special permit: only 3% are women. </p>

                <p>“This does not solve or prevent violence. This can increase violence,” Coraly León-Morales, executive director of the Casa Protegida Julia de Burgos women’s shelter said. “When there are firearms in the home –and the person who regularly has them is the aggressor– without having to say a word, it’s a way of intimidating and causes the women to desist from seeking help because that could put them at imminent risk,” she concluded.</p>
